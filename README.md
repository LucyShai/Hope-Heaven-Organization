# Hope Haven Organization - SheCode Hackathon Project

This project, created for the 2024 SheCode Hackathon, aligns with **UN SDG #1: No Poverty**. **Hope Haven Organization** is a platform designed to bridge the gap between donors and disadvantaged individuals in need of essentials such as food, clothes, blankets, and minor furniture items.

## ðŸŒŸ Inspiration
Our team was inspired by the idea that impactful change doesn't always require large sums of money or resources. We believe that even a single rand or a small donation of second-hand clothes can make a meaningful difference. This platform aims to facilitate easy and accessible donations for individuals and organizations who want to help uplift others in their communities.

## ðŸ’¼ How It Works
1. **Donor Registration and Login**: Donors create an account to track and manage their donations.
2. **Donation Selection**: Donors choose items theyâ€™re willing to donate, from food and clothing to minor household items.
3. **Delivery Options**: Donors can specify if theyâ€™d like to deliver items or arrange for a pickup.
4. **Monetary Donations**: Secure banking details are provided for financial contributions.
5. **Donation Tracking and Notifications**: Donors receive updates on the delivery process and can witness the impact their donations make firsthand.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
- To simplify the donation process, showing people that even small contributions have big impacts.
- To connect donors directly with those in need, making the experience personal and transparent.
- To reduce poverty and provide essentials to disadvantaged individuals, working toward a fairer society.
